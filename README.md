# Memory

Memory (also known as Concentration) is a card game played with one or more players. Using a standard card deck (including both jokers) the players shuffle the deck and lay all of the cards face down on a surface and two cards are flipped face up over each turn. The object of the game is to turn over pairs of matching cards. Concentration can be played with any number of players or as solitaire. [Wikipedia](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concentration_(game)>) has a good description of the game.

Your challenge is to build Memory in the browser with the requirements below.

7. When a player has found all 27 pairs, the player should see a success message

### Note on the server

This repository includes an Apollo GraphQL server. Much of the code that implements this server is located in dependencies. This is because we've done the work to set up the server for you already, and there's only one function you should need to alter to fulfil a bonus requirement. If you're unfamiliar with GraphQL, you should be able to get started after a brief study of the [Vue-Apollo Docs](https://github.com/Akryum/vue-apollo) and the [GraphQL docs](https://graphql.org/learn/). The endpoint for the server is located at `http://localhost:4000/graphql`.
