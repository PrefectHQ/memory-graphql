# Things I enjoyed
1. The project was easy to set up
2. I could write my Javascript, template html, and scss vue in the same component file. I woud probally have separated these scss into another file for production code.
3. The Vue Chrome Debbugger - this was nice when debugging my code and nice not to have to write console.logs
4. Vue was easy to learn and had similar directives to Angular (ex. v-if )
5. Vue has great docomentation

## Challenges
1. Traversing through the wrapper to count test child elements the wrapper
2. Understanding how to mock functions for testing based of the information in the docs
